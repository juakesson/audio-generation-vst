This project contains:

- A dev container distributed across the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json and .devcontainer/Dockerfile files. These define how the devcontainer should be created, from what basic image it should be created (an example image from Microsoft) and what modules should be installed using pip inside of the container. These files were created based on the following tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container

- Python for importing audio from a folder of audio files (TODO)

- Python code for training an audio generator based on these files (TODO)

- C++ code for embedding the audio data into a VST that can be loaded into any DAW (TODO)
